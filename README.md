# 6DPoseEstimationCNN
Multi Stage Convolutional Neural Network Based 6D Pose Estimation. In this repo, I provide code for my [IROS 2018 ]paper, "Detect Globally, Label Locally: Learning Accurate 6-DOF Object Pose Estimation by Joint Segmentation and Coordinate Regression".  Paper proposes a deep architecture with an instance-level object segmentation network that exploits global image information for object/background segmentation and a pixel-level classification network for coordinate regression based on local features. We evaluate our approach on the standard ground-truth 6-DOF pose estimation benchmarks and show that our joint approach to accurate object segmentation and coordinate regression results in the state-of-the-art performance on both RGB and RGB-D 6-DOF pose estimation.
